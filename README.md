# [DailyQuotes](https://daily-quotes-app.up.railway.app/)

## This is a fully functional web application that generates a motivational quote whenever a user logs in.

This project was a class assignment that required a full-stack application be built with a user sign in feature, link to a database to store user data and front-end development that best reflected the applications functions. I chose a motivational quote portal because at the time Covid-19 was in full effect and motivational quotes and videos were what I relied on to maintain a positive mindset.

## ❓ How to use it:

If it's your first time visiting the application:
1. Choose the Sign Up button.
2. Input the information being asked for.
3. Finish signing up.

If you have already signed up, then choose the Login button.

Once logged in, a motivational quote will appear on your screen, along with the author's name. You can refresh the page to generate a new quote.
